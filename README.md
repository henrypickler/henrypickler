### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

</div>

I'm a data scientist/ML reasearcher and graduate student.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on supervised learning with noisy labels
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about self-supervised learning!
- âš¡ Fun fact: Floating point arithmetic does not respect distributive or associative laws.

Areas of interest:
- Noisy label learning
- Self supervised learning
- Medical applications of ML
- Data science and data engineering
- Synthetic data, in particular how to measure quality and privacy.
